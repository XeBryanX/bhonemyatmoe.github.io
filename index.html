        <hr>
        In his early years, He attended Teacher Susan Preschool (Monywa) for kindergarten.  He later attended B.A.E (Monywa) for his 1st Grade. He switched schools to Panntagon ( Monywa ) for his 2nd and 3rd year which was a very traumatic school for him. He suffered massive amount of bullying, abuse and mental strain for a kid who was only 9.  Due to these reasons he later moved to Global Smart ( Monywa ) for his 4th, 5th and 6th years which were one of the best years of his life. He met so many great friends and people he can trust. Due to reasons concerning his safety, His parents sent him to Mandalay to study while living with his aunt and the only remaining grandparent.  He is currently attending GIC ( Mandalay ) for his IGCSE course.
